# Lavazza_Marketing
As coursework for the Marketing for Innovation exam at Bocconi, my team retrieved and analyzed free secondary data to come up with a product idea for Lavazza.
Lavazza's team evaluated our work with a mark of 29/30.

We used Python to retrieve Twitter data through an API, enabling us to create Positioning Maps and to assess the userbase of our client, which allowed us to identify personas and customer journeys.
Based on the above, we were able to propose an innovative product idea.


My teammates for this project were: Priamo Puschiasis, Simone Lorenzetti, Flavia Monaci, Alessandro Botti
