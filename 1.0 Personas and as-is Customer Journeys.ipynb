    "# 1.0 Personas and as-is Customer Journeys\n",
    "The foundation of our personas uses the analysis of Lavazza’s Twitter followers’ descriptions  as a building block, especially for Andrea and Arianna. Marta, instead, was framed relying on our personal knowledge and experience, as she is close to us, and on survey-like questions to the friends of ours that matched her main features. The specific characterizations are based on empathization, done on several data sources (mostly: internal material, other insights obtained through Twitter Api, readings of Amazon reviews of several coffee products) as well as by itself. For example, we can use Facebook ads creation to create a query combining interest for aperitif or coffee to being a universitary student 18-25 woman in Italy, thus obtaining music interests for one of our personas.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereby we present three personas that we identified, and their as-is customer journeys. In a section 2.0, instead, we will try to figure out how these personas might interface with our product, thus building customer journeys for our kits.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this section we use information retrieval on the descriptions of Lavazza's followers. Notably, after some pre-processing and cleaning, we use tf-idf, which is a technique that allows to filter out non-relevant information. Indeed, it returns only words (or, in better NLP language, tokens) that are very frequent in some descriptions but don't occur in most of the descriptions, otherwise they would be just noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the preprocessing and given the nature and diversity of this dataset, running a tf-idf is a bit of an overkill, as we obtain the same information given by simply collecting term frequency; though we can easily obtain both at the same time, and it's extremely fast anyway, so there was no reason not to implement it.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the info obtained, we framed 2 of our personas: Andrea and Arianna. Notably, we will be able to see a clear interest in travelling, as well as a general background in business-related jobs"

    "\n",
    "Arianna’s use of coffee is guided by different drivers, but let’s start with the moment of purchase. Her user need in this case is, obviously, refilling her coffee powder stocks. To achieve this, she will take one of the following routes:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Supermarket**, she usually buys it here, since it’s more convenient, as she can buy it together with her usual grocery shopping. Sometimes, though, she can lose track of some things, leading to pain points, for example having to walk to the supermarket if she’s out of stock, or, possibly, having to renounce at it altogether. Usually, walking by itself isn’t a problem for a person like her, but having to do so for a contingency certainly isn’t appealing. An opportunity to address these pain points is an app/service which, using localization and other data, reminds her to buy coffee powder when at the supermarket and almost out of powder. Of course she may not like the idea of being ‘tracked’, so it would work better if it just pops out a reminder when she is likely to have finished her previously purchased coffee powder.\n",
    "- **Online**,   buying online can potentially save her time, allow her to choose better and among more alternatives, and it can be more convenient as well. There are a lot of potential pain points though, for example there are longer timings involved she needs to be home when it is being delivered, there are expedition fees which can be annoying, as she might consider them as ‘wasted’ money, but there are also problems with setting the threshold for a free delivery or setting offers in general . Finally, she has some environmental sensitivity, so she may be bothered by excessive delivery packaging. As for the opportunities in this step, one needs to be careful with the offers and the free expedition thresholds, on top of sticking to essential packaging, possibly having cardboard of the right dimensions for most orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for her use of coffee, we distinguish among 4 main potential moments:\n",
    "-\t**Morning**, she consumes coffee as part of her morning ritual, to kickstart her day. She may need to wake up early to be able to prepare it while being on time, something which she cares a lot about. An opportunity here would be to have her use a machine or prepare it the day before and keep it warm\n",
    "-\t**Afternoon 1/2**, she uses coffee after eating, as a pleasure and a habit. Analysing Lavazza internal data and focusing on the Italian market, we can see that 24% of people interviewed in a survey conducted in 2016 drank coffee in the afternoon. In particular, consumers reported drinking coffee during this time of the day for several reasons: \n",
    "    *\tthey want a boost of energy\n",
    "    *\tthey want to take a break\n",
    "    *\tit is a habit\n",
    "    *\tthey want to relax\n",
    "    *\tthey want to spend quality time together with other people\n",
    "-\t**Afternoon 2/2**, she may take this coffee to relax, before resuming to her activity or switching to another one. Pain points include the fact that she may want to spend more time with this relaxing ritual, plus, after a bit, it can get old for a curios persona like her.\n",
    "This goes without saying that it may be the 3d or 4th coffee of the day, so it can start to get unhealthy. \n",
    "Opportunities include the ideation of a product which combines coffee with novelty and a longer, more active ritual, while possibly reducing the coffee intake for this moment Drinks coffee after dinner, if she has to work 'til late\n",
    "-\t**Evening**, she may consume coffee if she has to work ‘till late, although there is the obvious pain point given by the fact that it interferes with her sleep\n",

    "*Arianna customer journey during travel:*\n",

    "Here she may want to taste a decent coffee product that helps her to reach the right mood and get the most out of otherwise filler moments. Often, coffee lovers can’t resist the urge of having a coffee, even while flying, despite it being of extremely low quality. Furthermore, an active persona as our Arianna is easily offset by unavoidable waiting times, resorting to social media self-amusement which quickly leads to boredom anyway. We will propose the customer journey for this scenario in a more compact way:\n",

We still deemed important to be able to use the api, though. Indeed, as BA students, we need to be able to get results by coding.

    "-\tsocial opportunities to share with his friends or girlfriend, possibly in a cool place like the flagship store \n",
    "-\tpremium experiences in which to taste the amazing flavor of coffee. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, he is both a pleasure and status seeker.\n",
    "He tends to consume 2 coffees per day:\n",
    "\n",
    "The **first coffee** is in the morning. Andrea wants to start the day with coffee taste in his mouth, and not just the coffee but the preparation as well is part of his morning ritual. \n",
    "He is aware that only if made by him, or by a qualified barista, a coffee can satisfy his taste, as he knows the right combination of ingredients and timings, on top of the procedure to give the coffee the particular features he is seeking.\n",
    "For these reasons he gladly prepares the coffee by himself, enjoying choosing the perfect blend (among the wide variety of Lavazza blends he preserves in airtight containers) and doing all the steps his perfect coffee requires. \n",
    "In the morning coffee represents a moment of pleasure to be enjoyed, alone or with his girlfriend, in the peaceful atmosphere of his home. Neither the coffee from the automatic distributors at the workplace nor that taken in the nearest bar can be good substitutes. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Emotional driver**: pleasure seeking \n",
    "\n",
    "The **second coffee** is taken:\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tduring the weekend afternoons, while spending pleasant social time surrounded by his friends or colleagues in a fancy place, possibly trying to impress them by choosing among different brands and varieties, thus showing his coffee expertise, but without missing out on the opportunity to upload some Instagram stories.\n",
    "Functional drivers: status seeking. He has to show the coffee as a symbol, signaling his tastes and aesthetics.\n",
    "Emotional drivers: need for interpersonal interactions \n",
    "-\tduring the week, in the post-dinner evenings spent at home. Here coffee represents a moment to be shared with his girlfriend, allowing him to the end the day on a positive note, while possibly using coffee also as a digestive in this occasion.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Functional drivers**: need for a digestive, \n",
    "    alternative for the coffee he could not have taken in the afternoon \n",
    "\n",
    "    **Emotional drivers**: ending the day in a pleasant way, having a sort of  ‘reward’ after a  busy day\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main pain point in his general costumer journey**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The principal problem for Andrea is not having the opportunity to live to the fullest the afternoon coffee sharing/social moments. Indeed, during working afternoons, he can’t enjoy a premium and quality coffee experience with his friends of colleagues, as his best bet would be to call the serving from the nearest bar, or use the vendor machines during a break.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, while he is able to satisfy his ‘pleasure need’ by preparing good coffee at home both in the mornings and in the evenings, on the other hand, during the week, he needs some social moments during which high-quality coffee acts as a sort of symbol of his lifestyle, an opportunity to show his social status. Furthermore, we imagined some moments in which Andrea may have a coffee, but, looking at internal data (U&A italia 2016, slide 18), we can fairly rightly think that a certan number of Andreas isn't even able to get coffee during the week: workplace is, for many people, their only chance to have a coffee during the day, and it makes up for 30% of the outside-home consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This pain point in his customer journey is easily solved by the product we are proposing.\n",
    "Indeed, our kit would allow him to live a reinvented coffee experience at a time of the afternoon usually dedicated to aperitives more than to coffees, so he could invite his friends or colleagues at home after work, offering them sophisticated coffee-based drinks.\n",
    "In this way he would be able to impress them while spending some good time in company enjoying coffee at an otherwise unusual time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our product would also be a good alternative to the after-dinner coffee, since it offers him a way to end the days a bit differently, without having to give up on the coffee taste. \n",
    "In general, our product would be appealing to him for several reasons: first of all it brings together two otherwise different worlds, the aperitif and the coffee one, which he likes both. On top of this, it allows himself to live high status experiences with his friends, during which he can fully express his capabilities. \n"

Marta has a strict routine; coffee is a complementary aspect of it. Also due to the fact that she is not a “veteran” of coffee consumption, she hasn’t developed yet a strong affection or belonging to a particular brand, her main driver is purely functional.*\n",

    "-\t**Bar** -> Aside from other constraints, when she has time, this is her best call. Indeed she enjoys having a rounded experience, a satisfying moment for interpersonal interactions, the possibility of uploading IG stories, gaining higher status perception. She takes coffee without caring too much about brand or quality, the important thing is being with others. Her first choice is a macchiato or a cappuccino, not a basic espresso. Sometimes she has a complete breakfast also consuming food. In that case she enjoys the moment at the fullest.\n",

    "**The second coffee**:  the second coffee is taken after lunch. This coffee is totally functional driven, she needs to be mentally performing also after lunch, due to coming lessons or to her studying duties. \n",
    "Whether it is in a bar adjacent to the university, at home, or at the machines, coffee is taken according to the afternoon work. More than a ritual the attitude toward consumption is still a necessity.\n",
