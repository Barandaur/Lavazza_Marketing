    "Most functions can be called at the same time, as they don't overlap; for example, one can create a copy of the notebook and download ids in one and pages liked in the other. While doing so, though, it is ideal to start the call in the second notebook as the first one is sleeping, or to use different databases, in order to avoid occasional locked database errors (OperationalError: database is locked).\n",

The smartest implementation overall is the *faster version of get_followers*, where we check the tweepy_page in order to stop downloading followers when we reach the last page (very efficient and effective). It is a thought we had only after a while, so other functions could gain in efficiency by being adapted to use this same method\n",
