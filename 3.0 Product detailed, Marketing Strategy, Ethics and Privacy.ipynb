    "# A closer look at the product\n",
    "\n",
    "While the general idea of our product is pretty clear by now, there are a lot of details to be discussed when it comes down to prototyping. How many tastes and combination to create? How many instruments to include in each kit? Should all kits include such instruments? Should we create kits for each of our personas?\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions highlight some general potential pain-points in our kits:  the same persona, may need different kits, whether for taste preferences, number of servings, or because nobody wants to buy accessories already owned, having even to get rid of them, on top of environmental issues. \n",
    "Thus, not all kits should include such accessories in them, differentiating among “First time kit” and “Re-fill kit”, where the latter contains only the ingredients.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, kits may need to be different also across personas; for example Marta may want an analcoholic kit if she wants to use our product in the mid-afternoon, as a break from studying, while Arianna may specifically want a tsa-approved kit.\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing some quick maths, we see that *we would need a number of kits which is really hard to sell in retail*; this means that either one needs to investigate a lot of personas, find some common traits and sell just few kits,compatible with a decently broad audience, or other distribution channels have to be preferred, such as the online one. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will further discuss this issue in the next sections, when talking about our proposed strategy. Assuming, for now, that the **online distribution** solves this problem, another aspect must be taken into consideration: **packaging**. When we anylized competitors for Arianna's travelling customer journey, we have seen that spilling or damaged products can be a huge pain-point for our clients; thus, packaging should be optimized with regard to this issue. At the same time, packaging is part of the customer experience for these kind of products, so it should convey ideas of elegance and luxury, factors we considered important enough for our product to build positioning maps on them. These two aspects can be hard to combine, excpecially since we have large combinations of different types of kits.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to account for this is to standardize a lot of things, like the dimensions of the bottles, so that packages for the same number of servings can be the same, and can be designed well with regard to the two aspects previously highlighted. In this way, customer may also have a decent degree of customization, as, based on the number of servings they want, they can choose whether to buy a pre-designed kit or to choose by themselves what to include for each component, e.g. what alchoolic, what sweetener etc. He can also choose whether to include or not accesories, such as a shaker; if one chooses too many accessories, that couldn't be elegantly fit into a single kit, 2 different packages are delivered.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, **customization** is becoming a possibility, and Lavazza may change the package strategy according to the degree of customization; i.e. for the highest degree of customization one would need to care less about perfectly fitting products into pre-dseigned compartments, opting instead for putting them into bags inside the kit, or just opting for a bigger package in which, on top of a confetioned kit, there are also other products the customer asked for. This last possibility would allow customers to choose not only the particular instance of each kit component (e.g. which alchoolic, if any, among those that would fit for that number of servings), but also to buy products that wouldn't otherwise fit, e.g. several sweeteners instead of just one, or an alchoolic for a different number of servings. This would allow for a high degree of customization, while keeping the kit package design (actually a customer may even decide he doesn't want the kit package, if he prioritizes having less waste over luxury), although putting it into a bigger package together with other products, thus making the initial unboxing experience less 'luxorious'. Since customization is becoming a parameter for the general strategy, we will run an analysis on it in the next section\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We reasoned about the possibility of consuming the product at two different times of the day which imply different **recipes**: one that adapts to the aperitif while the other to a post dinner situation.\n",
    "For the sake of prototyping, we asked about possible recipes to friend of ours, who is a reasonably famous bartender/cocktail maker. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the aperitif kit, the cocktail to be prepared could be a shaken Campari (or a similar product) with a twist on the coffee: the preparation requires a short infusion with Lavazza coffee beans in the Campari, and then a shake with the red vermouth and ice.\n",
    "The result would be the revisiting of an aperitif classic with a note of coffee in flavour and smell.\n",
    "It is a classy cocktail and at the same time simple to prepare, it would have a minimum amount of caffeine which is an advantage since it is not customary to take pure coffee before dinner also for health reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As for post-dinner, we have a reinterpretation of the Martini espresso: it is simply a matter of shaking vodka, chocolate liqueur and an espresso and then adding orange sugar at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recipes | <font color = #ED7D31 > Ingredients </font> |<font color = #ED7D31 > Instruments  </font>\n",
    "--|:---------:|:-----------:\n",
    "<font color = 'green'>Aperitif Kit </font> | Campari | Shaker | \n",

    "    | Orange sugar \n",
    "    | Espresso\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Our product is perfectly suited as a **gift**, indeed since it will cost at least 15-20€ it is in the sweetspot cost range for gifts by parents, or by friends, as the price can also be much higher. Furthermore, it is an elegant gift, which shows the receiver that one knows and cares about his passions, whether they are for a particular alchoolic, for coffee in general, or for traveling. what we've just said holds particularly true for the traveller kit, as we can see by reading the reviews of the competitor product for this customer journey. Gift kits can contain additional nice gadgets, if bought online or at the flagship, like a Lavazza branded glass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, accessories included in kits are branded 'Lavazza', and there are possibility for limited edition versions or collaborations"

    "# Customization analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We ran an analysis on customization by brand. Notably, we will consider the percentage of followers of several brands that customize their own profiles on Twitter (changing both profile image and background settings). Of course, results may be biased by the fact that some users are less able or willing to go through the settings, and it is reasonable to think that this happens more the older the user is. Thus, if a brand only attracts older people, it may seem that its customers care less about customization; it isn't necessarily false, but it would be hard to infer, due to the spurios correlation. More in general, this metric is valid in a digital framwork, this may carry a bit of bias if we use results to generalize to an analogic scenario. Hopefully, since, older people are also less likely to use Twitter (Zagheni et al. (2017) research backs this up, altough it refers to another country and Facebook usage), and since customising one's background on Twitter is extremely easy and intuitive, this confounding doesn't impact too much results of the analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to check for the relevance of this bias (using Twitter data) would be to build a big enough dataset, keep the users who include age in their description, get other information on them, like the page liked, and build a ML algorithm that allows to classify into classes of age based on such information. If this algortihm does its job well, one can check for the correlation between age and customization in this setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Another possible objection to the analysis is that some brands may have more followers that use Twitter less, and, if a follower doesn't use Twitter, he has less chances of customising its account (it may even be a bot). We will do a robustness check for this behavour, which will consist in keeping only users who have published a minimum number of tweets *or* follow a minimum number of pages, considering these 2 parameters as a proxy for a minimum degree of Twittare usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping the first mentioned limit of the analysis in mind, results seem to have face validity, as brands like MonsterEnergy and Starbucks score higher on the percentage of customizing users, and so do brands about recipes sharing.\n",

    "Now that we have a product in mind, let move on to another relevent part: the marketing campaign.\n",
    "In order for our product to be successful, not only the underlying idea has to be catching, but also the way through which it is presented needs to be winning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For how we have the product in mind, we thought that we should start by targetting a small number of people, with a clear value proposition, and we think it's worth to **start with Andrea**. Indeed, the main disadvantage in doing so is that he has the smallest market size, but this could partly work in our way: it can make the product be perceived even more 'limited' and elitarious at launch, giving it more hype as well. Furthermore, he is likely to have a good convertion rate, as a lot of 18-35 Lavazza's followers fall into this category, so they're already clients, thus being easier to reach and conquer. Additionally, it is easier to launch the product giving it a really 'premium' aura, making it more accessible to other people later on, than to launch it with a more broad intent, having to win back Andrea's first impression when specifically targetting him. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, there is a potential risk in doing this: he is more easily dissatisfied and lost as a potential customer than, say, a Marta, if the product doesn't fully match his aspectatives; this means that the product must be well realized and sponsorized since the very beginning. There are also other reasons, though, for starting with him: he has one of the clearest pain-points, which we can address pretty well, and we didn't individuate many relevant potential problems for him in his customer journey for our product compared to, for example, an Arianna. Furthermore, he know well the world of coffe and aperitif, he is generally well informed about marketing initiatives, due to his job background and to the word of mouth of his colleagues, so it can be easy to make our value proposition clear for him, while the other personas can start to get a grasp about what our products is and why it can be relevant for them. Indeed, we think that, expecially when there will be a lot of kits, which will be necessary when considering a broad audience, it can be hard for some people to clearly understand what the kit is about, what it contains and so on. Thus, by launching the product for a smaller audience, we can start to accostume the market to our product, even if we will initially reach few personas that are not Andrea.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Later on, provided that things went well, Lavazza can start to **expand to other personas**, keeping in mind that each personas has its own needs, so the value proposition must be specifically tailored. Finally, expansion can be **worldwide**, together with the spread of the flagship store.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, at the beginning we target mainly people who already love coffee (that's why we based our personas on Lavazza's followers), as the idea spreads, though, we can target people coming from the aperitif world, or who are just interested in accessible premium/accessible luxury/trendy experiences. If we had to specify two **main goals**, indeed, they would be to increase the possible audience, reaching a new market, and to boost Lavazza's image with regard to the specified parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Another aspect to be discussed is that of **collaborations** with future competitors, like **Aperol/Campari**. From the positioning map of Andrea, we have seen that Campari has a brand image closer to that we may want to reach, so including such brand in our kits may help to achieve faster the objective of improving on luxury and premiumness, expecially for Andrea types. Furthermore, Lavazza isn't new to such a collaboration. Things may not be so easy, though, as previous collaborations were about specific events, thus temporary in nature. This time, instead, we will partly enter their market, so they may find more value in competing with us on a field they know better, rather than extabilishing a partnership. We think that it's likely that they would accept, though, as our product is something to be used once in a while, so, considering also the benefits of a collaboration, they can actually gain something from it, having, possibly, their products used in more occasions than before. We have computed a **clout-vulnerability** matrix with regard to them; of course, as of now there isn't a big overlap between Lavazza/Aperol/Campari, as they operate in mostly different markets."

While there are the generally valid considerations about sales volume et similia, we think that our product can have very specific long team goals. The main one could be to improve Lavazza's image with regard to its perceived level of premiumness, luxury and trendyness, thus gaining an important competitive edge over current competitors, excpecially for the 18-35 y.o. target market, arguably the most relevant one in the long run. Another important goal is to definitely open the door towards other markets, like the aperitif one, so that the future will have more possibilities. To check if Lavazza managed to join the aperitif market, it will be possible to make a clout-vulnerability map with brands like Aperol, seeing if it gained clout. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Other relevant performance metrics can be those expressed in the internal materials (Target Brand Health per Michele.pptx), so awereness, consideration and overall opinion of Lavazza, which can all be boosted thanks to our product, it things go well. Finally, a goal can be to improve the online and digital presence of Lavazza, a metric for this could simply be gathered by stats for the website/app, checking the overall sentiment and usage of them. Digital presence seems to be something that Lavazza cares about, indeed, according to Final_WAS_Y&R_Lavazza_ContentStrategy_2019_040519.pdf, some more specific goals (thus kpm to be checked for) are about making its digital presence perceived as more 'accessible premium' and 'contemporary', growing its u35 segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering these goals, our product can be used also in a strategic way more than as a tool to make money: if successful it can boost all the aforementioned aspects, so it can be fine not to make profits from it, as it would fulfill a strategic role"

    "Once the target has been chosen, the tools trough which reaching it have to be defined. \n",
    "Andrea is a sophisticated person; this has to be kept in mind while presenting the product in order to set the right status for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from the three following Andrea’s attitudes:\n",
    "1.\tHe makes use of social networks\n",
    "2.\tHe has an active lifestyle based on the research of premium and luxury experiences \n",
    "3.\tHe loves arts and culture \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " in order to make our product attractive we have decided to simultaneously follow different paths that include the use of social networks, the organization of special events, forging strategic partnerships that would allow Lavazza to take part in important business and cultural events, on top of trying to gain some space in lifestyle magazines.  \n",
    "Let analyse more in detail one solution at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### *Social Network*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Social media represent a double-edge sword. They offer the potential to reach whatever kind of person you want but at       the same time since they are a less controllable environment, available to all. If one wants to set his product as         something sophisticated he has to use social network with care, avoiding to give the impression of a for-everyone           product. Andrea is looking for something appealing and a too simplistic presentation of the product, with just, for         example, some videos on Facebook made in collaboration with widely known influencers, might be counter-productive,         suggesting the idea of a mass product.\n",
    "    For this reason we have opted for promoting our product only on Instagram and Twitter, leaving out Facebook, which we       think to be perceived as less 'premium' by personas like Andrea.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The strategy chosen to be fulfilled on Instagram consists in establishing a partnership with professional bartenders       like Bruno Vazan or Salvatore Calabrese. They will present coffee cocktail preparations in some short edited videos,       whose previews will be published as Instagram stories Ads. Swiping up will allow to reach the Lavazza website where to     get additional information about the product and watch the actual video, explaining in detail a certain cocktail           recipe.\n",
    "    A similar path will be taken on Twitter with the help of visually appealing Promoted Videos accompanied by a               captivating tweet copy including the Lavazza website link.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### *Organization of special events*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    With our coffee-cocktails kits, Lavazza would enter a new market, the cocktail one.\n",
    "    In this specific market Lavazza is not known; potential buyers may like the opportunity to try the product before the       purchase. This might be achieved by taking a big player in this market like Aperol as example. Aperol tends to organize     rooftops aperitif events. Lavazza might follow Aperol trail back and organize similar experiences that would allow to       confer the desired luxury and premium status upon our product, while allowing customers to familiarise with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### *Strategic Partnerships*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Partnerships give the opportunity to gain exposure and utilize new distribution channels. \n",
    "    The events to partner with have to be chosen intelligently. We want to put into the market a premium product therefore     also the ‘environments’ where to promote the Lavazza kit have to be of the right type.\n",
    "    Andrea works in the business world and is fond of art, culture and sports in general, therefore business and cultural       event are the perfect scenarios. \n",
    "\n",
    "    These considerations make a partnership with Fiera di Milano a strategic and promising alliance. Indeed, Fiera di           Milano is a business platform that through fairs and congresses offers an incomparable showcase to the leading sectors     of the ‘Made in Italy’. \n",
    "    Lavazza might exploit this opportunity by using Fiera di Milano as a springboard for the kit we are thinking to launch.     This proposal could prove extremely beneficial also considering the fact that to the present day the partners’ network     of Fiera di Milano does not include any other coffee brand (unless we consider Bialetti a possible competitor since it     also produces coffee capsules).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Another stage on which Lavazza could show off is the sporty one.\n",
    "    Lavazza has already entered the tennis world. As the Lavazza website says, tennis and coffee are two parallel words         which share many values including excellence, innovation, creativity and technical mastery (all characteristics that       also well apply to the Lavazza kit).\n",
    "    Lavazza has already been one of the main sponsors of Wimbledon in 2018 and of the Roland Garros in 2019. It has had its     reasons to focus on sponsoring abroad events, but now it has a good reason to do the same in the most important Italian     tournament: the Internationals in Rome\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Since we found out, in 1.0 (section pages_liked), that aproximately 20% of our Andreas type follow TedTalk, it             might be good opportunity to sponsor that event and organize a stand there as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### *Lifestyle Magazines*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    One of the info sources of Andrea is represented by lifestyle magazines.\n",
    "    Therefore, one channel that might be utilized in order to reach Andrea’s attention and make the Lavazza kit attractive     to him is the editorial one. \n",
    "    Some magazines like Esquire and Style, for example, are totally dedicated to style and elegance with a glance on the       world of lifestyle. They both include a dedicated section ‘food & drinks’ and they might be interested in writing an       article about how to prepare and enjoy fancy Lavazza coffee cocktails at home\n",
    "--- --- --- \n",
    "\n",
    "As for the **distribution channel**, we think that the ideal is to make it available online, at the flagship or similar stores, and in some of the mentioned events or similar ones. By doing this, taking advantage of the young targeted audience, we can make the product even more 'premium', as it is not widely spread, thus somewhat vulgarized, as in supermarkets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The online channel will give the customers the opportunity to personalize the kit by adding some fancy but not essential accessories (like muddlers, bar spoons, bar knives, jiggers, spirit measures, all branded Lavazza) and to choose among a certain number of cocktail recipes (for each recipe there will be a different kit with different alcoholic beverages and all the other necessary ingredients like spices, syrups and sugar). The catalogue from which choosing the type of cocktail to prepare with the kit will be initially reasonably small, but the possibility of customization will be expanded as we will start to target more personas.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Other advantages are that more users will use the site, giving us more information on them, while they gain more exposure to other Lavazza products. Finally, online one can share more information about the product, allowing Lavazza to have several kits (differening in number of servings, \"first-time\" or \"re-fill\", recipe etc.) without much of the confusion this would create by retail.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The experience can be truly premium in the Lavazza flagship store, a fancy place that will reflect the premiumness and luxury of the product, where the kit could be assembled directly in front of the client, permitting in this way to include also some ingredients with short-term expiring dates like fresh fruit, as well as hand-written messages for gifts.

    "[Back on top](#top) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we will have had success with Andrea and we will have obtained a spot in the cocktail market, we could start thinking to satisfy other market segments such as Marta's and Arianna’s.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Marta** is a student, and in the coffee consumption she is primary driven by a need for energy and a need for aggregation. She drinks coffee before (or during breakes from) studying, or when she is with friends. She is more functionally driven, compared to someone like Andrea. Our product would allow her to organize some pre/post dinner moments with her friends and to satisfy the status seeking she is looking for, by preparing and having something good looking in her glass. At the same time, she may just want to chill, unwilling to pursue a preparation which is complicated and time consuming.\n",
    "For this reason, somewhat different kits has to be developed in order to make our product suitable also for her.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A possible solution consists in launching two different **‘student edition’ kits** (with more to add at later stges) to sell also at the **supermarket**, one for an aperitif cocktail and the other for a post-dinner drink. Each will require very few preparation steps, including pre-batch cocktails to which to only add some coffee, without the need of any accessory, aside, possibly, from a shaker. In this way, we will provide students with an affordable, easy to realize product that still promises good looking results to be posted on Instagram, while still allowing them to explore other possibilities online. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This will also help in avoiding to propose too many kits in retail. At the same time, expanding to the supermarket can be a good idea to reach her. Indeed, students tends to arrange their evening plan at the last minute.\n",
    "If one's friends are going to arrive in an hour, going quickly to the supermarket is still possible, making an order on the Lavazza website and receive the kit immediately is not. \n",
    "However, when student go to the supermarket, they know exactly what they need and the location of the products they are looking for. They don’t usually ‘explore’ the shelves in search of new inspiring products. Thus, in order for our kit to be successful, it is best if students know about it before going to the supermarket. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To expose them to the kit, it is fine to use social media, but also more traditional means can be effective. For example, if, on top of Marta, Lavazza wants to target students who enjoy to relax watching reality shows (they can be a good match for an easy but tasty cocktail to consume alone or with house-mates), then TV commercials can be ideal as well.\n",
    "Aside from these possibilities and focusing on Marta, social media can work well, possibly with collaborations with other brands, such as Aperol if Lavazza will take this path. Another possibility would be to create an event or a situation that Martas will tend to share on their own, allowing Lavazza to indirectly reach their peers, rather than with an explicit commercial. Roughly, this is the idea behind some forms of ambient marketing, which can be a winning strategy to reach Marta. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding **Arianna**, she is a traveller and, as we highlighted before, she cannot bring alcohol in the airport. Similarly to Marta, Arianna needs a simple recipe because, during a flight, on the small airplane table, complicated preparation procedures are unfeasible.\n",
    "Hence the traveller kits will be similar to those developed for students with the main difference being that the alcoholic beverage will be actually alcohol-free and the kit will also provide a sachet of instant coffee. A bar spoon will be included as well, since a traveller cannot have his/her own kitchen utensils with himself/herself. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The traveller kit will also differ from the student one in term of packaging. A traveller mostly needs one-person doses and something that is comfortable to carry, meaning that in this case the kit will be smaller.\n",
    "For the initial marketing campaign, it is possible to make use of the already established collaboration with Luis. While he is travelling around the world for the ‘Breakfast Hub’ project, he might make additional videos where he prepares some cocktails with our kits, capturing on camera the curiosity of the other travellers. \n",
    "At the end of the video he refers to the kits if one wants to try himself, mentioning also a giveaway, to help spread the news and to boost the sentiment of those who will receive it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From the analysis carryed out in 1.0 (section pages_liked), we found out that more than 1 out of 4 Lavazza's followers travellers care a lot about luxorious journeys. This is good news for us, but we have to handle this segment well; indeed, he may not be interested or even reached by an advertising with Luis. Hopefully, though, he will be reached by the advertisement made for Andrea, as he seems to be a blend of these two personas. One could collaborate with Alitalia, that appears to be followed by a significant share of these personas, to specifically reach these customers in an elegant way, by potentially offering the kit not before the travel but during it, solving all the problems of making it tsa-approved. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, another idea, tailored to Arianna and Marta, is to organize an Instagram **challenge** where participants are asked to prepare their own take of a coffee cocktail and post a picture of it on their social pages. The recipe of the cocktail receiving more likes will be added to the online catalogue and will be given the name of the inventor. It is needed to consider this idea with care though, as an active social media marketing can [backfire](https://www.metro.us/mcdstories-mcdonalds-gets-fried-in-marketing-backfire/).\n",
    "If Lavazza deems worth to make this challenge, it can be used at the beginning, to help spread the knowledge of the kit's existance. Alternatively, one can opt for this challenge at a later stage, possibly to build a virtual community around a dedicated Lavazza **app**. Indeed, when there will be enough kits and people using them, Lavazza may want to launch an app specifically dedicated to cocktail kits, which can make it easier to users to navigate, customize, rate, and, possibly, discuss or share their works in a socialmedia-like feed"

    "Privacy is a big topic nowadays, to tackle its relation with out product, we must first make a small digression on the data our kits will make possible to retrieve, first considering what data Lavazza may want to gather and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our main distribution channel will be online, there are a number of information that Lavazza can gain from the purchases of our product, more so since it is more convenient to finalise the purchase upon logging in.\n",
    "First of all, since there will be many types of available cocktail kits, differing among key ingredients, it could be possible to build a recommendation system, based on what info the user provides on his profile and on his customer behaviour compared to other customers ones. Furthermore, this could allow also to understand better which kind of tastes are more appealing for a customer, potentially helping in the creation of new beverages or new cocktails, beneficial to the Flagship store as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Building up on this possibility, Lavazza could also launch new cocktails as kits to test how they are received by the market, since it can more easily obtain feedback online, thanks to tools like the review system. All of these possibilities would be more powerful if Lavazza manages to create an online community around this product, especially after the app release. Indeed, some customers may want to gather online for several reasons, for example to share their personal takes on the kits - more so if the customization aspect is emphasized - or to feel like belonging to a more ‘sophisticated’ niche of coffee users,  or just to express themselves, if Lavazza manages to create a space for them to do so. Not only this would boost product usage, but it would also provide access to more feedback and information, for example on when and how the product is consumed. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, connecting to the page with the instructions on how to make a cocktail would provide access to the aforementioned piece of information on when the product is used, allowing Lavazza to see if the kits are used in the moments of the day they were designed for. Indeed, while one may check the online recipe also much before making the cocktail, actually scanning the code inside the package is more likely to happen right before consumption.\n",
    "Data from the website/app could also allow to understand how frequently different customers purchase the product, which, combined with their personal information and the moment of the day in which they use it, could allow to better understand their drivers for the purchase; e.g., do they buy the product regularly and use it always around the same time, or do they buy it more frequently around some periods? Do they buy it for themselves or do they also request for a gift enveloping? \n",
    "In the latter case, it could be interesting to have information on the conversion rate of users who received the product as a gift. An idea to track this behaviour is to ask, upon registration, if the first time one has consumed the product was thanks to a gift. Furthermore, to incentivise the app usage and to potentially track who gave a gift to whom, people could have the possibility of inviting friends over the app, with the reward being a small discount.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, if one had access to such data, on top of what mentioned, he could know addresses, frequency of usage of kits (thus inferring on income level or potential addiction), one may have an hint about whether a person is about to travel (if he buys a travel kit without selecting the gift option). Furthermore, it could use data about when the user checks a recipe or logs the website to try to reconstruct his day and his moment of usage. Of course, Lavazza can use these data to ideate new products, hopefully keeping ethical issues in mind, but there is some sensitive information that needs to be protected"

    "Up to some years ago, ethical aspects didn't own their place in a business report. Though, with the rise of the importance of CSR, as well as with the change of some managerial paradigms, notably transitioning from the idea of just making profit to that of gaining prestige, things are slowly changing. In accordance with such changes, we will briefly talk about potential ethical issues of our product.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Alchool and coffee aren't two of the healthiest products, combining them can help alleviate the shortcomings of each, but it can boost them as well. An example of the former is that some people may satisfy their coffee needs with one our kits, which, potentially, can contain a smaller dose of caffeine. This would be particularly relevant, as the product is thought for an use in the afternoon/evening, when some people may already have drunk several coffees; while general research on benefits and harms of coffee is inconclusive, it is certain that a too large daily coffee intake can lead to major health issues.\n",
    "At the same time, though, the opposite of the scenario we just depicted can be true: some people that before would have consumed a simple aperitif beverage, or a sweet or even nothin, may now be attracted by this new product, thus increasing their coffee and alchool intake for that day. \n",
    "Despite this possibility, there are some good news: our product isn't exactly cheap, and it is thought to be used on occasions, so, if we focus on the average usage of our product, we can say that it is reasonably harmless.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Things aren't the same, though, if we focus on other aspects as well. Indeed, our product may bring some people closer to the world of alchoolics and coffee, leading, possibly, to addiction. Since a relevant part of our campaign is carryed out through online means, though, we can take advantage of technological advancments. One idea could be to collaborate with social media owners to identify and exlude from our advertisings people who are proner to incur into depression or addiction, using an NLP-based classifier. While it may seem an unfeasible idea, such technologies are already existant and in use, expecially from big brands like Facebook, so it's just a matter of putting them to good use, by specifically addressing this issue with social media companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, our product may bring more people to consume alchool and/or coffee during the evening, deterioring the quality of their sleep. While this doesn't generally seem like a big problem, it can become a matter of relevance if we consider those subjects who already come from a deteriorated mental state, for whom quality of sleep is particularly important to give them the energy and strenght to fight their battle. Thus, similar considerations to the above apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One realistic opportunity Lavazza has for doing CSR on this potential problems, would be to make donations to mental health organizations, advertising it in a campaign in which it disencourages eccessive use of its own products, promoting a sustainable coffee culture."
